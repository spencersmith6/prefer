First she tackled the  unfortunate Scott expedition to the South Pole inThe Birthday Boys; later (but emphatically pre-DiCaprio) came the sinking of the Titanic, inEvery Man for Himself. Now, in her 3rd historical novel (and her 16th overall), she takes on the Crimean War, and the result is a slim, gripping volume with all of the doomed intensity of the Light Brigades charge--but, thankfully, without the Tennysonian bombast. Some pictures, a character confides, would only cause alarm to ordinary folk. Theres a warning concealed here, and one that easily disturbed readers would do well to heed:Master Georgieis intense, disturbing, revelatory--and not always pretty to look at.Bainbridges narrative circles round the enigmatic figure of George Hardy, a surgeon, amateur photographer, alcoholic, and repressed homosexual who counters the dissipation of his prosperous Liverpool life by heading for the Crimean Peninsula in 1854. His journey and subsequent tour of duty are told in three very different voices: Myrtle, an orphan whose lifelong loyalty to her Master Georgie becomes an overriding obsession; Pompey Jones, street urchin, fire-eater, photographer, and Georges sometime lover; and Dr. Potter, Georges scholarly brother-in-law, whose retreat from the wars carnage and into books takes on a tinge of madness.United by a sudden death in a Liverpool brothel in 1846, these characters plumb the curious workings of love, war, class, and fate. In between, Bainbridge frames an unforgettable series oftableaux morts: a dying soldier, one lens of his glasses fractured into a spiders web; a decapitated leg, toes poking through the shreds of a cavalry boot; two dead men on their knees, facing one another, propped up by the pat-a-cake thrust of their hands. Glimpsed as if sidewise and then passed over in language that is as understated as it is lovely, these are images that sear into the brain.Master Georgieis full of such moments, horrors painted with an exquisite brush.--Mary Park--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "Master Georgie"}, {"asin": "0001064487", "imurl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41bI6DhG7SL.jpg", "title": "Celebremos Su Gloria"}, {"asin": "0001042335", "imurl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZSAPAXN4L.jpg", "description": "William Shakespeare is widely regarded as the greatest playwright the world has seen.

Irina sees the old rocking horse in a junkstore window and decides she must have it. The proprietor, sensing her need for it, gives Bella to her, and tells her about a live Bella, a beautiful, once-wild horse that used to belong to a local farmer who mistreated her. As the wooden horse gradually comes to life, Irina blossoms. She is happier than she has ever been, especially when her Bella takes her on thrilling midnight rides. One cold winter night, the animal leaves the child to run through the hills with a herd of wild horses. Irina is devastated. Too late she realizes she has not heeded the storekeepers warning Never say that any creature on this earth is yours.... She withdraws into herself again-until Bella returns, bringing her injured foal for Irina to nurse. This time she promises herself to let it go when it is grown. In so doing, she frees herself to grow up. The message may seem obvious to some, but that will not deter young horse lovers and beginning readers of fantasy, who will be absorbed by the details of equistrian care, the magic of the animals transformation, and the excitement of the late-night rides. The many fine black-and-white drawings convey Irinas sadness, Bellas magical changes, and the strong energy of the galloping horses.Virginia Golodetz, St. Michaels College, Winooski, VTCopyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "The Enchanted Horse"}, {"asin": "0000143529", "price": "19.99", "imurl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51QY79CDfjL._SY300_.jpg", "description": "Disc 1: Flour Power (Scones; Shortcakes; Southern Biscuits; Salmon Turnovers; Fruit Tart; Funnel Cake; Sweet or Savory; Pte  Choux) Disc 2: Super Sweets 4 (Banana Spitsville; Burned Peach Ice Cream; Chocolate Taffy; Acid Jellies; Peanut Brittle; Chocolate Fudge; Peanut Butter Fudge) Disc 3: Super Sweets 5 (Lemon Meringue Pie; Pie Crust; Yeast Doughnuts; Doughnut Glaze; Chocolate Doughnut Glaze; Sugar Cookies; Royal Icing; Chocolate Peppermint Pinwheel Cookies)", "title": "My Fair Pastry (Good Eats Vol. 9)"}, {"asin": "0000477141", "price": "41.22", "imurl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ky-L29jTL.jpg", "title": "MKSAP 15 Audio Companion"}, {"asin": "0001437879", "imurl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PA8hajWWL._SL500_.jpg", "title": "Great Hymns of the Faith: King James Responsive Readings"}, {"asin": "0001035649", "imurl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51P6XDFRVKL.jpg", "title": "Under Milk Wood: Dylan Thomas &amp; the Original Cast"}, {"asin": "0001381245", "price": "5.47", "imurl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/A1%2B%2BKHnzuVL.jpg", "title": "Misty of Chincoteague"}, {"asin": "000102521X", "imurl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516TRJBF9XL.jpg", "description": "For lovers of extravagant words and action charged with mystery and passion, Mr Jarvis must be hard to beat.

The book opens as the Little Princess screams, I want my dinner! The picture of her red-faced temper tantrum, complete with silverware flying through the air, shows more than the text reveals. Next, she demands her potty (while squeezing toothpaste all over the cat). Finally, she remembers to say the magic word when she requests her teddy bear. Then, on a walk, she encounters a big, red-nosed blue Beastie. He pitches a fit about wanting his dinner, and the Little Princess tells him to say please. The smiling, yellow-crowned child reminds him to say thank you, too. The simple text combined with exuberant, colorful watercolors show Ross at his best. Any child who has been reminded to be courteous will appreciate the cheerful, comical illustrations.?Janet M.

At the moment of his departure, he wishes to offer the people gifts but possesses nothing. The people gather round, each asks a question of the heart, and the mans wisdom is his gift. It is Gibrans gift to us, as well, for Gibrans prophet is rivaled in his wisdom only by the founders of the worlds great religions. On the most basic topics--marriage, children, friendship, work, pleasure--his words have a power and lucidity that in another era would surely have provoked the description divinely inspired.
